Assignment 2 Update & Clarification
I want to clarify an issue in Assignment 2 and share an update.

In the original data.py, the code was using only the top 5 sentences to generate skip-gram pairs. This was my oversight — I temporarily modified the code to test skip-gram without negative sampling and forgot to switch it back.

I’m really glad that some of you caught this and brought it to my attention.

What’s changed?
You now have two valid options for Assignment 2:

Use data_5sents.py (old data.py behavior)

This version works correctly, but it only generates skip-gram pairs from the top 5 sentences, so you’re effectively training the embeddings on a tiny subset of the corpus.

This is fine for a quick run or comparison baseline, but you should expect weaker or less stable embeddings compared to training on the full dataset.

Use data_full.py

Train embeddings on the full dataset

To control vocabulary size and training time:

Words occurring fewer than 50 times are filtered out (same strategy as gensim)

Frequent stop words are downsampled to accelerate training

I tested both approaches and also tuned several hyperparameters. In particular:

Early stopping shows that ~5 epochs are sufficient (no need for 25)

Larger batch sizes (increase it from 128 to 512) improve GPU parallelism and gradient stability

I used Adam, while Jack used SGD

Training completes in about 20 minutes on a T4 GPU in Google Colab

All updates have been pushed to the course repo, please sync your fork with the course repo to get the latest changes.

If you’ve already submitted, you are completely fine.
No resubmission or changes are required.

As always, feel free to reach out if you run into issues or have concerns. We’ll talk about different optimizers in next lecture so you can better understand the trade-offs between them.

🙌 Shout-out
A big thank you to Jack Yu for spotting the issue, modifying the data.py file, and sharing his solution — much appreciated!
